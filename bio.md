  <p>I help simplify the message for web projects at <a href="{{site.work_link}}">{{site.work_org}}</a> in Collinsville, CT. We build fantasy gaming apps for professional and collegiate sporting organizations. NFL, NASCAR, PGA, </p>

  <p>Over the last 10 years, I've spent a good bit of my time in Photoshop, HTML and CSS. I've designed and developed for many of the PHP based CMS's, worked in ColdFusion, and more recently in MVC'ish frameworks like Rails and Angular. I like to think of myself as a technically proficient designer.</p>

  <p>In my spare time, I like to travel to the mountains with my wife and kids. I also play drums and noodle a bit on bass. I absolutely love subbing on gigs with musicians I've never played with. It's so much fun!</p>
