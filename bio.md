  <p>By day, I help design and develop large scale web applications for <a href="{{site.work_link}}">{{site.work_org}}</a> in Collinsville, CT. We build fantasy sports games for the NFL, NASCAR, PGA, and many other professional sporting organizations. Have a look at my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/portfolio">portfolio</a> for some of my most recent design and development projects.</p>

  <p>In the evenings and on weekends, I work as a Front End Web Developer and Modern Web Design Mentor at <a href="http://thinkful/com">Thinkful</a>. I work with students to help them establish new careers in web design and/or modernize their current skillsets. It's a rewarding job, and it helps me to stay current in this fast paced industry.</p>
  
  <p><strong>I am currently available for freelance design and front end development work</strong>. <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">Contact me today</a> to discuss your project.</p>
