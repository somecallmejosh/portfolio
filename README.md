Joshua Briley Portfolio
=======================

Thanks for checking out my portfolio.

## Responsive Images
Using image srcset attribute with polyfill.

## Full Flexbox Layout
Assumes visitor is using a modern browser

## Typekit Typography
I'm trying this out. Not completely sold on the async loading, considering the FOUC. I'll continue to tweak this, or consider using an embedded font or a websafe alternative.

## Jekyll Static Site Generator
Using Jekyll to build locally.

## Serving from Git Hub Pages
Because paying for hosting wasn't my first choice.
