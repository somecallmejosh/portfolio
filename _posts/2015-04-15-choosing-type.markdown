Choosing a typeface for the web can be a daunting task. There's lots of stuff to consider. Where will it appear? What's the context? Navigation? Paragraph? Headings?

The two basic typefaces to consider when working on the web are **text** and **display** typefaces


## Text Typeface

Choose a text typeface before choosing a display typeface. This is the anchor typeface.
First priority is legibility. Things to look for are: 

* Good legibility
* Good x-height. X-height should be 60-75% of the cap height.
* Good letter spacing. Looser letter spacing is better.
* Overall even color. 
* Trick is to blur your eyes when looking at the typeface. Do you see any dark splotches or uneven patches of color showing up.
* Counters should be open and clear (holes inside the letters)
* Mood of the typeface should be consistent with the overall feeling of the brand.

**Things to consider**

* Does the web font have a range of weights?
* Does the typeface have italic styles?
* Will we need different widths for versatility?
* Are small caps necessary?
* What accented characters are included for language support?
* What kind of numerical figures are needed?

###Numerical Styles

**Old Style**

* Vary in height and extend below the baseline sometimes.
* Good for body copy.
* necessary  for use with small caps.

**Lining Figures**

* Same height and baseline
* Good for headlines
* Good for all caps.

###Cost Considerations

Web font licensing can be costly. Subscription based models can run between $25 and $100/year.


##Display Typeface

* Generally large, thick letters.
* Good for big headlines, site titles or pull quotes.
* Make sure it's legible and readable. Do the squint/blurred eye test, to see if the typeface has an even overall color.
* Should have a tighter spacing than text type faces.
* Should have shorter ascenders and descenders.
