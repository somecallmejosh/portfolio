I think this may be one of may favorite new finds because I thought I'd have to use Javascript to accomplish this task. What task, you ask? How about using only CSS to partially hide items that are `:not` being `:hover`ed over. No need to traverse or otherwise manipulate the DOM. A simple CSS psuedo class, is all it takes (assuming you only care about the good browsers).

This technique is so awesome that I began using it on this blog. Yeh, I stole the idea from Pinterest, but isn't that what the web is all about? Great designers steal, right? ;-)
