I'm a sucker for self-help and personal finance books. Gladwell. Covey. Dave Ramsey. These are just a couple of the authors that line my *digital bookshelf*. I picked up a new book called **You, Inc.** by Harry Beckwith and Christine Clifford. So far, it's typical and predictable. Same content, with a different spin. The difference, however, is that it's inspiring me to act. So, without further adieu, I present my Goals for 2015.

* Complete the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree course (*in progress*).
* Take my family on a memorable vacation (*research in progress*).
  * Alernative is to design and build a new deck in the back yard.
* Continue my passion for music by playing 1 to 2 gigs per month (*discussions in progress*).
* Build a craft room for my wife (***complete***).
* Lose 30 lbs, by continuing in Hapkido and moving to a Mediterranean diet (*avoiding*).
* De-clutter the house by selling unecessary music equipment, and getting rid of old clothes (*avoiding*).

This is a start... Can you help me see these through?
