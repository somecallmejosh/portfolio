Here are a few common terms associated with typography:

* **Typeface** - the design of a colletction of characters. Called a font-family in CSS.

## Elements that shape a typeface
* **Cap Height** - height of the capital letters
* **Baseline** - guideline for which the majority of characters rest.
* **X-Height** - height of the lower case x in a typeface. Higher x-height generally has higher legibility for smaller typefaces.
* **Descender** - parts of the letters that extend below the baseline.
* **Ascender** - parts of the letters that extend above the Cap height.
* **Serifs** - projections that finish off the main strokes of a letter.
* **Contrast**
  * **High Contrast** - Thick vertical strokes, thin horizontal strokes.
  * **Low Contrast** - horizontals and verticals appear as same stroke size.
  * **No Contrast**
  * **Text Color Contrast** 
* **Color** 
  * **Actual Color of words**
  * **Overall density or ink**
  * **Uneven color** - heavy headlines, for instace, with regular text.

## Serif Typefaces

### Humanist Serif
Right after printing press in 1450. These are based on the strokes of a pen and have strong calligraphic influence. Diagonal stress, lower stroke contrast, smaller x height and their serifs are not as refined.

* [Kennerely](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-kennerley/)
* [Centaur](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/centaur/)

### Old Style Serif
Came from the later part of the 15th century, through the 17th century.
