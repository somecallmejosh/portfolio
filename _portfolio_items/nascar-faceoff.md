## Objective
The goal for this project was to revive an older NASCAR fantasy application that had been placed on the back burner years ago. The idea was to keep the same functionality, but give it a modern face-lift. Once completed, NASCAR would then pitch the project to sponsors for funding.

## My Role
Use the old project as a guide for designing similar game components for a new revision of this project.

## Creative Process
This was a general re-skinning of an older application to work with a new set of branding guidelines set forth by NASCAR. We were taking a very image-heavy, web-2.0-style application and creating a new light, flat design with a more meaningful visual hierarchy. This was a matter of pulling down a Git Repo, launching an older Rails application, and looking for ways to improve the layout.

## Project Duration 
Design cycle was 1 week.

## Design Challenge
I never really watched NASCAR prior to this project. I'd always thought the driver who crossed the finish line first was the driver who won. I had no concept of team racing. No concept of Chase Challenges, Sprints, etc. The big challenge here was in gaining an understanding of how this series of races was any different than the others.

## Challenge Resolution
I had to spend a couple of days with team members who'd worked on NASCAR projects in the past. I had to bury my head in the main NASCAR website for a while to get a feel for how things worked. I'll be honest in saying that I'm still pretty unclear on some of nuances of the sport, but I'm definitely more informed than I was. :-)

## Business Result
NASCAR was pleased with the project, however a sponsor for the game was never secured. No worries, this project led to many others that followed.
