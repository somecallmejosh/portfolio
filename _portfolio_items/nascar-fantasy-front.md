layout: portfolio


objective: NASCAR.com was changing from a very dark, web 2.0 style, to a modern sleek, editorial design and needed help converting their fantasy games to follow suit. A secondary objective was to improve performance on their fully responsive app.

my_role_on_project: Primary designer on complete redesign of their fully responsive fantasy landing pages. Also, find and fix performance improvements opportunities within the site. 

creative_process: This project redesign started with a style guide provided by NASCAR, but they were very open to suggestion. One of the main concerns of the old style was "where do I start?", and "what am I supposed to do next?" So, the main goal in the creative process was finding ways to simplify the layout. Two of the primary tools for accomplishing this were whitespace and color consitency. A hierarchy could now be seen, at a glance. The pages were much easier to scan and navigate.

project_duration: Design and development cycle was around 3 months

design_challenge: Working with an older code base can provide multiple challenges. Working with an older code base that was created in an era where responsive design was cutting edge... well, that's a horse of a different color. With that said, the performance improvement challenge was huge. This project took full advantage of the cascade, and mapping styles back to their original locations in the project became a major challenge. Seemingly simple Sass/CSS changes unexpected results.

challenge_resolution: In many occurences, specificity allowed for overwriting of some rules, and I was able to minimize a metric ton's worth of background and inline images with more modern CSS3 techniques. 

business_result: Follow up contract awarded for NASCAR Live, NASCAR Streak, and NASCAR Chase fantasy games.
