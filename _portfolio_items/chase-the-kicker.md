objective: Design a website that helps with recruiting of a college bound high school kicker.

my_role_on_project: Primary designer and Sass, HTML, and PHP developer. Dad.

creative_process: After having seen some great photography of him posted on HUDL, I immediately purhcased a few of the pics, and worked around them. Several Photoshoping sessions later, I came up with a layout that he and I were both happy with. We used the color scheme of his high school to tie everything together. 

project_duration: Design and development cycle was about 2 weeks.

design_challenge: Chase was a yellow-chip recruit in high school. He knew that he needed to work hard to gain the attention of college scouts. He needed help setting himself apart from other kickers who simply relied on their coach's websites and HUDL to display their data. So, we designed and built him a marketing platform.


challenge_resolution: I designed a site for Chase that prominently displayed his seasonal stats, and gave viewers the opportunity to dig in for highlights and additional information regarding Chase's 'recruitability.' We tied this in with a Mail Chimp campaign and Google Analytics. Together with these tools, we were able to track down coaches who were interested, allowing him to make contact and setup meetings. This was a true Guerilla Marketing endeavor, and it was so much fun. I learned a great deal about the recruiting process and how to help develop a recruiting strategy for young athletes.

business_result: Chase signed with UCONN during his senior year in High School.
