  title: Senior Software Engineer at Puppet Labs, Inc.
  testimonial: Josh is a highly productive and well-organized front end designer. He was hired at East Point Systems to head up user interface design and implementation for an AngularJS based web application. Josh was always ahead of schedule with the implementation of his responsibilities, so this allowed him to tackle other marketing duties where he saw a need for improvement. He personally interviewed staff to develop a benefits-based picture of product offerings, and he used this to simplify and relaunch a fresh design for the company website.

  testimonial: Josh has a great eye for simple design. His web sites are clean yet comprehensive. Beyond this, Josh is a self-starter in every sense of the term. He consumed design and marketing tasks in short order while the rest of us tried to keep up. This left him opportunities to start branching out into development work and left me impressed with his ambition.

  testimonial: Joshua is a uniquely qualified individual with many different business talents. He has the ability to digest new information, whether technical or business and create actionable items. He was brought in as a UI designer but we got so much more. He designed our front end of our latest product and helped us redo the entire website for the company. He has the uncanny ability to take very little information and transform it into something great! He also has project management experience, and is extremely self motivated, needing little direction to move a company forward. Joshua is a hardworking professional, who I personally recommend for a UI designer, project manager and business analyst.

  # testimonial: Although I only knew Josh for a short time, his design mockups for the company's upcoming product were fantastic to look at, very clean and very functional, and with each new update I felt the final product was truly going to be something to behold. As an amateur designer in my free time, I would have loved to have the opportunity to pick at his knowledge and learn a few new things to apply to my own work. Always a pleasure to converse with, and definitely recommended for any team.
